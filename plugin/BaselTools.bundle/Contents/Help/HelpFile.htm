<p>Binsert</p>



<p>It produces
the same result as Bind &amp; Insert for a drawing with xrefs.
So it will Bind the xrefs with the
insert option.</p>

<p>CompletionHelper</p>

<p>It is a tool that works
similarly to DataFilter, and it is used
the same way, but it does not filter
the excel sheet at all. It provides a list of all possible values for each
field and you will be able
to select the one you
want between all given possibilities.</p>



<p>You need: A PSD &quot;from style&quot; named CompletionHelper,
it must contain 2 properties:</p>



<p>FileName: path
and name to the XLS file</p>

<p>DataName: the
named data range in the XLS file</p>

<p>It is useful to have
a list of “official names” so that no one
makes typing mistakes.</p>



<p>DataFilter</p>

<p>Reads property values
from an Excel sheet and presents a form where properties can be selected.
Its functionality is similar to
the same named function in MS Excel. Excel header
row names and property names
must match exactly. Overrides are possible
and will be marked red.</p>



<p>You need:
A PSD &quot;from style&quot; named
DataFilter, it must contain 2 mandatory properties:</p>



<p>FileName: path
and name to the XLS file</p>

<p>DataName: the
named data range in the XLS file</p>

<p>(optional)“Check Value” If this property is
set to “True”, you can only
apply your settings if all values are set
to proper ones (nothing is red
or there are no empty
fields).</p>

<p>TIP:
Configure the double click action for space tab to start this command
automatically. Datafilter.jpg</p>



<p>DetachXref</p>

<p>With this
command you can detach(remove) a xref by clicking the xref object.</p>



<p>ExcelReaderLog</p>

<p>Produces
the same result as ExcelReader but provides more output in the command line to
see exactly what it does and at the same time helps to identify problems when running
ExcelReader.</p>



<p>This is a
typical output in the commandline when you run the EXCELREADERLOG command:</p>



<p>Command:

<p>ExcelReader
- Properties: 10 created, 0 replaced, 1 skipped, 0 ignored.</p>

<p>Here are
some typical messages and their meaning during the EXCELREADERLOG command:</p>



<p>&quot;Entering:...&quot;:
looking for objects in the Modelspace or in Layoutsspaces.</p>



<p>&quot;Collecting:...&quot;: found an object with the
&quot;ExcelReader&quot; Property Set Definition to work with
him later.</p>



<p>&quot;Reading &quot;Planlist.xlsx!DATA&quot;:
Tried to read a excel file
with name
&quot;Planlist.xlsx&quot; and inside
it, the named
range &quot;DATA&quot;.</p>



<p>&quot;File
not exists: C:\Planlist.xlsx&quot;: the file or the drive is not found, or it
is not readable (network or external drive).</p>



<p>&quot;No
values in cell range name: DATA&quot;: there is no named range with name DATA
or the data range is empty.</p>



<p>&quot;First
Row:...&quot;: the values from the first row of the named range. These values
must match with the property names in your property set definition.</p>



<p>&quot;Can't
find Keyname: xxx on the yyy object&quot;: there is no property with name xxx
on the object yyy. This property is needed as Keyname to find the right values
in the excel sheet.</p>



<p>&quot;Can't
find Keyvalue “xxx” on the “yyy” object, in the excel file&quot;: the value xxx
was not found in the excel file for the yyy object.</p>



<p>“Work with “xxx””: get an xxx object and work with
it.</p>



<p>“Try to set
Property “xxx” to: “yyy” – Skip”: the new value is the same value as the old
one, so it jumped over and let the old one as it is.</p>



<p>“Try to set
Property “xxx” to: “yyy” – Failed”: it tried to set the new value, with no
success, typically because the Property was write protected like automatic
properties or formulas.</p>



<p>“Try to set
Property “xxx” to: “yyy” – Replaced”: an old value was overwritten.</p>



<p>“Try to set
Property “xxx” to: “yyy” –New”: an empty property got a value.</p>



<p>“1 created,
2 replaced, 3 skipped, 4 ignored”: that is the result of the process, 1
property got a new value, 2 were replaced, 3 were skipped and 4 were ignored
(failed).</p>



<p>&quot;Nothing
changed, xxx is empty!&quot;: there are no values in named data range(inside
the Excel file).</p>





<p>ExcelReaderOpen</p>

<p>This command
opens all used excel files which are used from the ExcelReader command.</p>



<p>XMLREPAIR</p>



<p>This tool
was invented to repair the project navigator.</p>



<p>For a
proper work with the project navigator is it absolutely necessary that every
dwg file has a related xml file. This tool creates or repaired this xml file.
It is necessary that you open at least one drawing from a project navigator
project. Every folder that
you select will be fixed including
all subfolder.</p>

<p>-BSTSpaceAdd2</p>

<p>to review!!!</p>





<p>creates one
ore more spaces this command works similiar to the -BSTSpaceAdd command with
the capability to create several identically spaces</p>



<p>the following
values are mandatory:</p>



<p>x,y and z
value of the bottom left corner of the rectangular space</p>

<p>length and
width of the space</p>

<p>number of
spaces to create</p>

<p>a name of
PropertySetDefinition, a PropertyName and a value to this Property.</p>



<p>This
example creates 3 spaces of 2x4 meters at the location 0,0,0 with an PSD
&quot;BST-Room&quot;, the Property &quot;RoomNumber&quot; gets the value
&quot;A-01&quot;</p>



<p>-BSTSPACEADD
x,y,z,length,width,numbers,PSD-Name,PropertyName,PropertyValue:
0,0,0,2,4,3,BST-Room,RoomNumber,A-01</p>



<p>BSTspaceaddcmd.png</p>





<p>This
command was developed to work together within a script. Here is an simple
example based on Excel:</p>



<p>File:BSTSpaceAdd
Commandline Example.xlsxMicrosoft Excel - BSTSpaceAdd Commandline
Example.xlsx.png</p>



<p>TIP: Use
the ExcelReader command to fill further properties an such created space
object.</p>

<p>-BSTSpaceAdd</p>



<p>BSTSpaceAdd</p>



<p>-BSTMultiSpaceAdd</p>



<p>ExcelReader</p>

<p>Reads
property values from an Excel sheet and fills up the values with the same name
into objects Properties Set Definitions when a matching Keyname is found.</p>



<p>It is
actually nothing more as an simple database query.</p>



<p>Excel
header row names and property names must match exactly.</p>



<p>You need:</p>



<p>A
Properties Set Definition(PSD) &quot;from style&quot; named ExcelReader, it
must contain 3 properties:</p>



<p>FileName: path
and name to the XLS file.</p>

<p>DataName: the
named data range in the XLS file.</p>

<p>KeyName: the
property name with the Value that will be matched
between XLS and PSD.</p>

<p>ExcelReaderPSD.png</p>



<p>This is a
screenshot of the XLS file from the example above:</p>



<p>BST-Planlist.png</p>



<p>inside
AutoCAD we need one AEC object like a Door, a Space or a MV-Block. On this
object-style we connect the ExcelReader-PSD, and fill the properties with the
File-, Data- and KeyName. To transfer the information from the Excelsheet to the
AEC-Object you need a PSD on that object with properties with the same name as
the columns in the Excelsheet:</p>



<p>PSDExample.png</p>



<p>You need
just a single property to fill inside AutoCAD. In our
case it is
the Plannumber, defined in the ExcelReader PSD as &quot;KeyName&quot;.</p>



<p>The
Excelreader command is looking for this value in the Excel file inside the DATA
named range in the column &quot;Plannumber&quot; for the value
&quot;1000&quot;. If he find them, the command try to fill the value from all
other columns into the proprieties of the same name on the object. In our
example is this all other properties. Properties and columns which are not
matched exactly (it is not case sensitive) will be ignored.</p>





<p>PSDExampleFilled.png</p>



<p>Here is
a small video to demonstrate the query process:</p>





<p>see also</p>

<p>ExcelReaderLog</p>





<p>RealXrefInsert</p>



<p>It produces
the same result as Bind+Explode for a drawing with
xrefs. So it will first Bind the xrefs and then
will Explode the xrefs so that we
have at the end a drawing with the
original entities inside.</p>



<p>OSMIN</p>

<p>The OSMIN command was developed to create
an Figure-ground diagram based on openstreetmap data.</p>



<p>Be aware
that the produced plan is a mercator projection. This means only along the equator
the size of the plan is correct. The rest is scaled. As example in Basel is the
length diference approxinatle 40% longer than the reality.</p>



<p>CAD-BST-OSMtools.png</p>



<p>To use this plugin you
need an .osm
file. You have to download
them from the openstreetmap project.</p>



<p>First click
on the export option on the website (1.)</p>

<p>Chose the
area that you want import(2.).</p>

<p>Click
&quot;Export&quot; to download the area as .osm file(3.).</p>

<p>OpenStreetMap
Export.png</p>



<p>inside
AutoCAD:</p>



<p>You can
find a command button on the BST Ribbon or you type OSMIN in the command line.</p>



<p>ImportOSM.png</p>



<p>Select a
the downloaded file and choose an importstyle.</p>





<p>This is what
you get with
the &quot;Black&quot; style:</p>

<p>OSMIN-Black.png</p>





<p>This is what
you get with
the &quot;Mapnik&quot;
style:</p>

<p>OSMIN-Mapnik.png</p>



<p>You will see
more information when you using
the &quot;Mapnik&quot;
style. </p>

<p>But even there
not all information are visible, some layers
are switched off. All imported layers starting with name
OSM_. Independently from the choose import
style all available information's
will be used. The (small) differences are in the color
and naming of the layers.</p>

<p>The imported area
is geo-referenced, if you import
an area </p>

<p>nearby it
will be imported on the correct position. </p>

<p>&quot;Points
Of Interest&quot; (POI) are imported as blocks on the layer </p>

<p>&quot;OSM_NODE&quot;,
all available attributes are stored as attribute.</p>



<p>-BSTMultiSpaceAdd</p>

<p>creates an
several space object by a given total area and number of sub parts.</p>



<p>the
following values are mandatory:</p>



<p>x,y,z
values of the bottom left corner for all spaces the number of areas to create
the total of all areas a name of PropertySetDefinition, a PropertyName and a
value to this Property.</p>





<p>This
example creates 5 squared spaces with a sum of 25 sqm (5 spaces with 1x1
meters) at the location 0,0,0 with an PSD &quot;BST-Room&quot;, the Property
&quot;RoomNumber&quot; gets the value &quot;A-03&quot; -BSTMULTISPACEADD
x,y,z,numberOfAreas,totalArea,PSD-Name,PropertyName,PropertyValue:
0,0,0,5,25,BST-Room,Roomnumber,A-03</p>

-BSTSpaceAdd</p>



<p>BSTSpaceAdd</p>



<p>TIP: Use
the ExcelReader command to fill further properties an such created space object.</p>



<p>-BSTSpaceAdd</p>

<p>creates an
space</p>



<p>the
following values are mandatory:</p>



<p>x,y and z
value of the bottom left corner of the rectangular space</p>

<p>length and
width of the space</p>

<p>a name of
PropertySetDefinition, a PropertyName and a value to this Property.</p>



<p>This
example creates an space of 2x4 meters at the location 0,0,0 with an PSD
&quot;BST-Room&quot;, the Property &quot;RoomNumber&quot; gets the value
&quot;A-01&quot;</p>



<p>-BSTSPACEADD

object.</p>



<p>BSTSpaceAdd</p>



<p>creates a
square space-object</p>



<p>the
following values are mandatory:</p>



<p>the area of
the space</p>

<p>at least
one name of a PropertySetDefinition, a PropertyName and a value to this
Property.</p>

<p>you can add
several properties</p>



<p>This
example creates a squared space of 25 sqm (5x5 meters) at the location 0,0,0
with an PSD &quot;BST-Room&quot;, the Property &quot;RoomNumber&quot; gets the
value &quot;A-02&quot;</p>



<p>BSTSPACEADD</p>

<p>Enter the
area value for the space: 25</p>

<p>Enter
property set definition name to add on space: BST-Room</p>

<p>Enter
property set definition name to add on space:</p>

<p>Enter property name
to set: RoomNumber</p>

<p>Enter value

<p>SelectByProperty</p>

<p>With this
tool we are
able to select
an AEC element dependant from his properties.</p>



<p>On this example
you will select all elements where the Level property inside the BST-Room property set
definiton is &quot;2&quot;.
All related object will be add to
the curretnt selection:</p>



<p>Select by Property.png</p>



<p>SIADIM</p>

<p>In exceptional cases
you can use
this tool instead of the
AEC dimensions, which also support DIN/SIA formating. Please discuss with us CAD managers.
SIADIM is an tool to display
dimension values related to the SIA or DIN standard on &quot;normal&quot;
AutoCAD dimensions, this means centimenter are show differently as meters, and
millimeter values are shown as superscript:</p>



<p>SiaDim.png</p>



<p>This tool
needs to be implemented in a project phase by a CAD manager, it is not
available otherwise.</p>



<p>Layerlist</p>

<p>creates a
list of the layers you have in your current drawing: color, linetype and
description. You can get a plain list(ungrouped) or an grouped list. The last
one has not include AutoCAD layers 0, Ashade and Defpoints It asks for you for
the insertion point of this list.</p>



<p>The output
of the LAYERLIST command, left without grouping - right grouped Layerlist.png</p>



<p>PropertyRenumber</p>

<p>This
command is intend to number a property on a PropertySetDefinition (PSD). You
need in addition to the PSD a polyline to describe the number order and
direction. In the example below at first we number all rooms from 1 to 30
clockwise, because the red polyline was drawn clockwise. After that some spaces
will be deleted and inserted so that the old
numbering didn't match anymore. We repeat the
command with the same polyline and all number are correct again.</p>





<p>RemoveSiaDim</p>

<p>This tool removes
the text overide from a dimension line text. This override was produced with the
SIADIM tool.</p>
